## Fuel Consumption Analysis with Python

Welcome to the Fuel Consumption Analysis project repository! In this assignment, we delve into a dataset of cars regarding fuel consumption, aiming to gain insights and perform analysis using Python.

### Dataset Overview
The provided `cars.csv` dataset contains valuable information about cars and their fuel consumption. The assignment tasks involve utilizing Python, specifically Pandas, to perform various analyses on this dataset.

### Assignment Tasks
1. **Dataset Examination:** We start by loading the dataset into a Pandas dataframe and examine its features and examples.
2. **Missing Values Detection:** Identifying features with missing values and determining the count of missing values in each.
3. **Imputation:** Filling in missing values using appropriate imputation methods like mean, median, or mode.
4. **Fuel Economy by Country:** Analyzing which country produces cars with better fuel economy through box plots.
5. **Distribution Analysis:** Identifying which feature ('acceleration', 'horsepower', or 'mpg') has a distribution most similar to a Gaussian distribution by plotting histograms.
6. **Quantitative Measure:** Supporting the answer for part 5 with a quantitative measure.
7. **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating the correlation between 'horsepower' and 'mpg' through scatter plots.
8. **Linear Regression:** Implementing closed form solution of linear regression to predict 'mpg' from 'horsepower' and visualizing the learned line on the scatter plot.
9. **Quadratic Function Regression:** Performing quadratic function regression to predict 'mpg' from 'horsepower'.
10. **Gradient Descent Algorithm:** Implementing gradient descent algorithm for simple linear regression.
